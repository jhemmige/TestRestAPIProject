There are 2 challenges in RestAssured API

1. Build Payload and Send to API. This can be done by ..copying the payload(or body) inside the .body of the script or creating a method for the payload and calling that 
method in the body of the script.So, In addition to this, we can also create Java Object for the payload and call the Java obj 
2. Parse the response as per our wish

Serialization: 
Process of converting Java objects to Request payloads( or Body) is called Serialization. via pojo classes
POJO - Plain Object Java Class
In serialiazation, we use setters value playing a keyrole but in deserialization , we use getters.

In Deserialization: 
We convert the Json response obtained to Java Objects.

Converting response into Java Object
We need some external libraries to get serialization and deserialization.



GetObjects & PojoClass1GetCourse Notes

First we crete a Pojo Class called "GetObjects"
1. We create variables for all the nodes here. 
{ "instructor": "RahulShetty", "url": "rahulshettycademy.com", "services": "projectSupport", "expertise": "Automation",
"courses": { "webAutomation": [ { "courseTitle": "Selenium Webdriver Java", "price": "50" }, { "courseTitle": "Cypress",
"price": "40"
},
{
"courseTitle": "Protractor",
"price": "40"
}
],
"api": [
{
"courseTitle": "Rest Assured Automation using Java",
"price": "50"
},
{
"courseTitle": "SoapUI Webservices testing",
"price": "40"
}
],
"mobile": [
{
"courseTitle": "Appium-Mobile Automation using Java",
"price": "50"
}
]
},
"linkedIn": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-shetty-trainer/"
}

2. We get the getters and Setters for the variables. 
3. Since Course has a sub Json, we create another pojo class called "PojoClass1GetCourse"
4. From the "PojoClass1GetCourse" we will call the variable into courses.
5. Change the Return Type to GetCourses for Getters

6. Remove the error for setters by changing the argument according to the class. 

(watch 65. Creating POJO classes for the real
time Nested Array Json) 
7. Now, create 3 more pojo classes called WebAutomation, Mobile, Api since courses include these.
8. These courses in turn include coursetitle nad price inside arrays hence GetCourses is changed to list and returntype being class for each course.
